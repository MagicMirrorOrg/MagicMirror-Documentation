# Module Development Documentation

This documentation describes the way to develop your own MagicMirror² modules.

## General Advice

As MagicMirror² has gained huge popularity, so has the number of available
modules. For new users and developers alike, it is very time-consuming to
navigate around the various repositories in order to find out what exactly a
certain modules does, how it looks and what it depends on. Unfortunately, this
information is rarely available, nor easily obtained without having to install
it first. Therefore, **we highly recommend you to include the following
information in your README file.**

- A high quality screenshot of your working module
- A short, one sentence, clear description what it does (duh!)
- What external API's it depends upon, including web links to those
- Whether the API/request require a key and the user limitations of those. (Is
  it free?)

Surely this also help you get better recognition and feedback for your work.

## Module name

We recommend the following pattern: `MMM-MyNewCoolModule`. But it is not
mandatory - your module will also work with other name patterns (as long as no
other module has the same name).

## Quick start

To rocket launch your module, you can use the
[MMM-Template](https://github.com/Dennis-Rosenbaum/MMM-Template) or immediately
[MMM-Template](https://github.com/new?template_name=MMM-Template&template_owner=Dennis-Rosenbaum).
Please read the
[MMM-Template wiki](https://github.com/Dennis-Rosenbaum/MMM-Template/wiki) for
more information.

**Please note!** This module is an externally developed module and not
maintained by the MagicMirrorOrg.

## Module structure

All modules are loaded in the `modules` folder. The default modules are grouped
together in the `modules/default` folder. Your module should be placed in a
subfolder of `modules`. Note that any file or folder you create in the `modules`
folder will be ignored by git, allowing you to upgrade the MagicMirror² without
the loss of your files.

A module can be placed in one single folder. Or multiple modules can be grouped
in a subfolder. Note that name of the module must be unique. Even when a module
with a similar name is placed in a different folder, they can't be loaded at the
same time.

### Files

- **modulename/modulename.js** - This is your core module script.
- **modulename/node_helper.js** - This is an optional helper that will be loaded
  by the node script. The node helper and module script can communicate with
  each other using an integrated socket system.
- **modulename/public** - Any files in this folder can be accessed via the
  browser on `/modulename/filename.ext`.
- **modulename/anyfileorfolder** Any other file or folder in the module folder
  can be used by the core module script. For example:
  _modulename/css/modulename.css_ would be a good path for your additional
  module styles.
