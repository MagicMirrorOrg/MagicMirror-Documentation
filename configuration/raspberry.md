# Raspberry Specific

This information here is based on the latest release of 
[Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/) ("Trixie") from October 1st 2025.

## Adding colored icons

Raspberry Pi OS does not come with colored emoji icons by default. To add them, install the following package:

```shell
sudo apt install fonts-noto-color-emoji
```

## Rotating the screen

See the [official documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#set-resolution-and-rotation)
