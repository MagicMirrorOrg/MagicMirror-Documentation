# MagicMirror² Manifesto

The following core principles form the foundation of MagicMirror² and guide our
decisions and actions. They reflect the project’s commitment to simplicity,
accessibility, and community-driven innovation.

## Vision

To empower Raspberry Pi enthusiasts and developers of all levels by providing a
platform that combines **simplicity** and **magic**, inspiring curiosity and
collaboration in open-source development.

## Mission

- **Preserve** the core philosophy of simplicity, ensuring that users can
  confidently modify and experiment with the software.
- **Inspire** contributors by transforming MagicMirror² into an approachable
  entry point into the world of software development.
- **Advance** the platform continuously while keeping accessibility and
  modularity at its heart.

## Core Principles

- **Accessibility for All**: MagicMirror² strives to be the ultimate starter
  project for Raspberry Pi enthusiasts. Whether you’re a beginner taking your
  first steps or an experienced developer looking for a creative outlet,
  MagicMirror² aims to be intuitive and welcoming.
- **Fostering Learning**: The project is not just about delivering a
  product—it’s about empowering users to explore, learn, and contribute to
  open-source development. We believe in inspiring curious minds to step out of
  their comfort zones and try new things.
- **Modular and Open**: MagicMirror² is designed to be modular, allowing
  contributors to easily add or remove features. Each module reflects the
  diverse creativity of the community, while the project remains open to new
  ideas and improvements.
- **Simplicity as a Foundation**: While we embrace technological advancements,
  simplicity remains a basic cornerstone of the project. As the project’s
  founder, [stated](https://github.com/MagicMirrorOrg/MagicMirror/issues/1174):

  > _We could use a powerful framework like Vue to ramp up the development
  > speed. We could use SASS for better/easier CSS implementations. ... But the
  > big downside of these changes is that it over complicates things: a user no
  > longer will be able to open just one file and make a small modification and
  > see how it works out._ --Michael Teeuw

  This principle ensures that MagicMirror² remains approachable, empowering
  users to take control of their projects with confidence.

- **Collaborative Growth**: MagicMirror² thrives on collaboration. Contributions
  from the community—whether through code, feedback, or ideas—drive the project
  forward. We aim to create an environment where users feel valued and
  encouraged to contribute.

## Inspiring Contribution

MagicMirror² is more than just a tool – it’s a platform that invites users to
become creators. By keeping the system accessible and open, it motivates
individuals to step beyond being passive users and to actively contribute to the
project.

Although bundled versions and pre-packaged solutions may seem convenient, they
risk suppressing users' curiosity. As Michael has highlighted, _"users won’t be
motivated to take a peek under the hood. They will just remain 'users'."_
MagicMirror² challenges this dynamic by encouraging even non-technical users to
explore, learn, and take their first steps into software development.

Through this philosophy, MagicMirror² not only provides functionality but
fosters a community of learners, innovators, and collaborators – ensuring that
its magic is driven by the passion and creativity of its contributors.

## Future Directions

Building on our philosophy of fostering contributions, we aim to continue
evolving MagicMirror² with the active involvement of its community. Each new
feature and improvement will stay true to the spirit of collaboration and
openness that defines this project.
