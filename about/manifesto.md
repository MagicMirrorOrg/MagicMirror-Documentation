# Manifesto

A real Manifesto is still to be written. Till then, Michael's response on
[one of the repository issues](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/issues/1174)
gives a great summary:

> "... I started this project as an ultimate starter project for Raspberry Pi
> enthusiasts. As a matter of fact, for most of the contributors, the
> MagicMirror project is the first open source project they ever contributed to.
> This is one of the reasons why the MagicMirror project is featured in several
> RasPi magazines.
>
> The project has a lot of opportunities for improvement. We could use a
> powerful framework like Vue to ramp up the development speed. We could use
> SASS for better/easier css implementations. We could make it an NPM
> installable package. And as you say, we could bundle it up. The big downside
> of of of these changes is that it over complicates things: a user no longer
> will be able to open just one file and make a small modification and see how
> it works out.
>
> Of course, a bundled version can be complimentary to the regular un-bundled
> version. And I'm sure a lot of (new) users will opt for the bundled version.
> But this means those users won't be motivated to take a peek under the hood.
> They will just remain 'users'. They won't become contributors, and worse: they
> won't be motivated to take their first steps in software development.
>
> And to be honest: motivating curious users to step out of their comfort zone
> and take those first steps is what drives me in this project. Therefore my
> ultimate goal is this project is to keep it as accessible as possible."
