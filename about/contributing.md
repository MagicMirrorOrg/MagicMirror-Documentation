## Working Language

To ensure inclusivity, collaboration, and accessibility for contributors from
all around the world, we have chosen English as the working language for this
project. Here are the key reasons behind this decision:

1. Global Accessibility: English is widely recognized and understood, enabling a
   diverse group of contributors to participate, share ideas, and collaborate
   effectively without language barriers.
2. Uniform Documentation: Using English for documentation ensures that all
   project materials are consistent and comprehensible to the majority of
   developers, regardless of their native language.
3. Broader Community Engagement: By using a common language, we can engage with
   a broader community, attracting talent and contributions from various regions
   and backgrounds.
4. Resource Availability: Most technical resources, tutorials, and libraries are
   available in English, providing contributors with a wealth of information and
   tools to support their work.

We understand that choosing English as the working language is not the perfect
solution for everyone, as it may present challenges for non-English speakers.
However, it is the best compromise to ensure effective communication and
collaboration across our diverse and global community.

If you are not comfortable with English and cannot use translation tools, please
feel free to use your native language in the forum. However, please keep in mind
that asking questions in English is more likely to get you help quickly.

We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in using English as the working
language. Together, let's build something amazing!
