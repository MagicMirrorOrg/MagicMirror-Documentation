# Upgrade Guide

::: danger WARNING
Always backup your `config.js`, `custom.css` and `modules` folder before you start the upgrade process!
:::

If you want to update your MagicMirrorÂ² to the latest version, use your terminal to go to your Magic Mirror folder and type the following command:

```
git pull && npm run install-mm
```

If you changed nothing more than the config or the modules, this should work without any problems.

::: danger WARNING
Using `git reset --hard` as described below will delete all your changes made in the source code, so only execute this if you know what you are doing!
:::

Type `git status` to see your changes, if there are any, you can reset them with `git reset --hard`. After that, `git pull` should be possible.
