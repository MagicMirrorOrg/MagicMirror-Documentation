# Core Development Documentation

This documentation describes core MagicMirror² development.

## General

MagicMirror² is a community-driven development effort, and
[contributions](../about/contributing.md) are welcome!

In general, new features and bug fixes should be tracked against an
[issue in the MagicMirror repo](https://github.com/MagicMirrorOrg/MagicMirror/issues).
It is always a good idea to search existing issues to see if a problem you're
experiencing has already been reported, or if someone has already suggested a
feature you'd like to propose. Creating or finding an issue also starts the
discussion and helps build consensus around your proposed fix or feature.

The MagicMirror² core is
[developed on GitHub](https://github.com/MagicMirrorOrg/MagicMirror/) out of the
_develop_ branch. To begin developing MagicMirror² core, please fork the GitHub
project and create a new branch based off of the _develop_ branch.

When your development is ready for review and testing, create a new _Pull
Request_ targeting the _develop_ branch. The development team and other
contributors will be able to review your changes and provide feedback, and the
test system will run automated tests against your changes. Make sure to mention
the issue(s) that your Pull Request solves.

## Development Environment

Although Node.js applications are typically platform-independent, many of the
scripts created for MagicMirror² are Linux-based. While Windows/Mac development
is possible, you may run into issues. (Improvements here are welcome!)

You will need to have [Node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download). When
doing Linux development, on newer distributions Node.js is available from
package managers.

Many Node.js or experienced Javascript developers have an environment that works
for them. New developers to Node.js / Electron can download
[VSCode for free](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and use many
extensions available for debugging and developing Javascript.
